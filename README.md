# Enterprise-Web-Application
CSP-584, Illinois Institute of Technology

Course Description:

This course discusses the architectures, technologies and techniques used in the development of the object-oriented enterprise web applications
using technologies such as AJAX, Servlets, Java Server Pages, HTTP protocol, XML/HTML, Sessions/Cookies, JDBC, and Multithreading. Multitier architectures, application servers, 
client-server model and MVC architecture will be discussed and analyzed. The course also discusses the application architecture and the process to store the transactional data
in document-oriented or relational database engines and how to connectthe application servers  to social media websites to collect the data for further analysis 
using Python/Pandas and use the results of the analysis in effective marketing campaigns, sentiment analysis , and focused advertisement.

Objectives:

++ Explain the n-tier architectures and demonstrate how they are utilized in building the enterprise web applications.
++ Recognize and analyze the core elements of the Web application architectures
++ Acquire the technical skills to utilize technologies used in the analysis, design , and development of the enterprise web applications
++ Utilize the MVC architectural pattern in the design and development of the object-oriented web applications
++ Explain the impact of SQL and NoSQL database technologies on the enterprise web applications and architectures
++ Extract and transform data from SQL and NoSQL database systems to generate and present information reports
++ Collect data from social-media servers that could be used by the enterprise for effective marketing campaigns, sentiment analysis , and focused advertisement

Topics Covered:

++ Enterprise web application architectures
++ Client-Server Model and n-tier architectures

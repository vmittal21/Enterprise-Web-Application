5fcb04ac01aa7c5876ccb5c2,healthhubReviews,steven@gmail.com,Calcium and Magnesium With Zinc Tablets,mixed feeling,3,I have mixed feelings about this product. I bought it because we have been trying to have a baby for about 6 months now and I read that taking these would help. I only took these pills for about a week... and I got pregnant. So that??s awesome! They worked for me.. however. There is magnesium inside which if you don??t know make you poop A LOT. It works as a laxative. It was hard for me to be at work because I would randomly have to just run to the bathroom and explode. But after I went I was fine. So I??m so grateful for these pills that I believe helped me get pregnant. But I stopped taking them shortly.,60616,Chicago,4.99
